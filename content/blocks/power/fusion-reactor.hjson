type: ImpactReactor
localizedName: "[cyan]Fusion Reactor"
description: With the pinnacle of Blue-Wolframite electronic technology, hydrogen atoms can be ripped from water with a ton of power to be used in nuclear fusion. The Draconium casing is durable enough to contain the small star being sustained inside.
